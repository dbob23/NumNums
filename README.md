# NumNums

This is a capstone project for LaunchCode's LC101 class.

It is a web based application built using Java, Spring, Thymeleaf, MySQL, and HTML.

The purpose is to allow users to search within a specified range for restaurants that can provide meals that meet certain dietary restrictions including gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan, and vegetarian diets.

This project has user registration and login/logout, and create, read, update, and delete functionality for restaurants using a SQL database. It is still in development, and will soon display search results based on distance as links to restaurants' webpages and as clickable locations on a Google Maps interface.
