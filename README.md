# NumNums

This is a capstone project for LaunchCode's LC101 class.

It is a web based application built using Java, Spring, Thymeleaf, MySQL, and HTML.

The purpose is to allow users to search within a specified range for restaurants that can provide meals that meet certain dietary restrictions including gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan, and vegetarian diets.

This project is still in development, but will soon provide create, read, update, and edit functionality for restaurants using a SQL database, and display search results as links to restaurants' webpages and as clickable locations on a Google Maps interface.
