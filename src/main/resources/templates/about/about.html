    <h3>About NumNums</h3>
    <div>
        <p>"NumNums!" is a capstone project for LaunchCode's LC101 programming course.</p>
        <p>It is built with Java, Spring Framework, Thymeleaf, JavaScript, Spring Boot, Spring Security, MySQL, JSON, Bootstrap, and HTML. Users can search within a specified range for restaurants that meet dietary restrictions including gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan, and vegetarian diets. Through the use of MySQL queries and Google Maps APIs, the database is searched for restaurants found within a search radius using the "great circle equation". Those restaurants are then filtered to correspond to the user's personal dietary selections. Once retrieved from the database, results are displayed in both a list format and as markers on a googleMap. Each marker can be clicked to show the restaurant name, street address, and website URL in an infoWindow.</p>
        <p>This project also incorporates user registration, password and email address confirmation, and login/logout functions that allow create, read, update, and delete functionality for a database of user inputted restaurants.</p>
        <p>Making 'NumNums!' has been a tremendously rewarding experience. It is the first project that I have completed on my own. In the process, I was able to teach myself how to use Spring Security, GoogleMaps and GoogleGeocode APIs, JSON parsing, and JavaScript, all for the first time. While any project of this size can be improved and refactored, I am satisfied to see my original idea made into a fully functioning app.</p>
